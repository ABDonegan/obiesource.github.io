    "bio": "Hello! I'm a 3rd year double-degree student majoring in Computer Science and the Pipe Organ. I am from the New York/New Jersey area. In addition to computer programming my passion is playing the organ, and I operate a Youtube channel where I upload recordings of the organs here on campus! My most favorite thing about programming is web-design, and have recently got into static website hosting using javascript! If you would like to learn more about the organ, feel free to follow my Instagram page (@FiskFan1999), where I post memes and other funny content about the pipe organ and early music.",
